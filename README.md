Summative Assessment 1 for ENGG 21
## INSTRUCTIONS:

Form a group of 4 to 5 students. 
1. Publish an R Markdown on RPubs and submit the link. Only one member of the group should publish and send the RPubs link but EVERYONE MUST CONTRIBUTE on its contents.
2. Within the markdown document, answer and discuss the following probability problems:
  - Briefly discuss the Monty Hall problem and share your insights and solution to this brain teaser problem.
  - One of the most popular major games of PCSO is the Ultra Lotto 6/58. At ₱20 per ticket, how much would a bettor spend to cover all of the possible combinations. Would the grand prize of ₱50 million cover all the expenses or it would simply incur a massive loss on the bettor?
3. Be creative. You can use markdown templates and cheat sheets to be able to add images, links, or anything that you think is necessary to answer these questions.
